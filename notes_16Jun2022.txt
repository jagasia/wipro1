Webservices
	SOAP
	RESTful

What is a web service?
	type of api

api
	application programming interface
		always stands between 2
		client & web component

	if we want to create a web component, then Servlets & JSP are web components

	how do web service differs from web component?

When there is Servlet, JSP, then why do we need Web service?

	web component runs in the server

Before 2001
----------------
There were lot of applications developed using different programming languages
But they were not interoperable.

Today, we are developing a REST api in java spring boot.
And from Angular, we are able to access the REST api.

Today, we are able to develop a REST api in DotNet
and from react/ angular, we are able to access the rest api.

In fact, from spring boot mvc project, i am able to access a rest api (that was created in dotnet).

This is TODAY.

But before 2001,
	interoperability was not there.

Applications developed in different languages,
	running in different platforms,
	cannot interact with other applications, developed in different languages, running in different platforms

So, the problem was the applications were developed in such a way, they are converted into binary and the binary is different for java/ dotnet etc

Why we need interoperability?
	There are lot of code been developed by
	different enterprises.
	The enterprises are integrated and hence
		enterpise applications need to be integrated
		EAI	Enterprise Application Integration

	ICICI bank ATM card used in SBI ATM machine	(integrated)

VISA
Master card

Example for EAI

	BookMyShow app allows payment using
		Credit cards
		Debit cards
		Net banking
		UPI
	


Interoperability
	is the ability to allow other applications to
	access our web component

problem is 
	our web component is developed in java
	then applications developed other than java
	could not be able to access them

to be frank,
	there is a method in our web component
	from dotnet program, a method should call our method.	THIS IS THE REQUIREMENT

not possible because of the difference in platform and language.

To be able to achieve this,
	the data transfer from and to must be in a standard format


that standard was decided to be XML standard
by World Wide Web Consortium	(w3c)

XML was introduced in 1999

in 2001, w3c recommended xml as a standard for web

web services are introduced
	amazingly, web services created in one language, running in a platform, CAN BE ACCESSED FROM any program running in any platform.
this is interoperability

2001	SOAP webservices

What is SOAP
	Simple Object Access Protocol
		the message sent from client to the web service
		and
		the message received from webservice to the client

		both are in SOAP format

soap message
	envelope
		header	(optional)
		body


XSD
	XML Schema Definition

WSDL
	Web Services Description Language

once a webservice is created, a documentation is automatically created.
WSDL is the documentation

if you got the webservice URL,then	append ?WSDL		you will get the DOCUMENTATION
http://localhost:8080/abcd?WSDL

SOAP webservice standards:
	HTTP
	XML
	SOAP
	UDDI
		Universal Description, Discovery and Integration
			registry to register the webservices. And clients can discover the webservices from the registry




SOAP means xml formatter
	the data is sent and received in xml format

in rest api,
	default is 	text/json
	but rest api, supports many type of formatters

How to create a soap webservice?
using eclipse/ sts.

There are 2 approaches.
	Bottom Up Approach
		we have the code.
		from the code, we need to generate web service

	Top Down Approach
		we have WSDL 
		from that we need to generate the webservice


Bottom Up Approach:
---------------------------
1) we create a dynamic web project.
2) create a java class that has business methods
	example:
		CalculatorImpl
			add
			subtract
			multiply

3) extract an interface for this impl class
		Calculator 
4) right click the project
	add -> new -> web service
5) choose approach
	bottom up 
6) choose the interface "Calculator"

---------------------------
Use eclipse for SOAP webservice demo:
Task:
1) create a dynamic web project
2) create a impl class
3) extract interface from the impl class
4) RIGHT click project
	create -> new -> web service
	bottom up approach
		select the impl class
5) next -> finish
	if prompted, "Start server"
6) go to the client project generated
	open the service locator class
7) copy the  address and paste in brower
	http://localhost:8080/jun16-soap-2/services/CalculatorImpl?WSDL

8) APPEND 
	?WSDL to the url


--------------------------------------------
http://localhost:8080/jun16-soap-2/services/CalculatorImpl?WSDL

Let the web service be running.
DO NOT STOP that

We can create one more project
	JAVA Project

a web service can be called from any type of project

To call a webservice,
	first obtain a proxy of the webservice
	How?

Right click the project
	add -> new -> web service client

--------------------------------------
Task:

For the web service we have created,
lets create a java project
that acts as a client

right click project
	create new web service client
		use the WSDL url
	use the proxy to call the web service methods


SOAP webservice
	methods
		parameter
			datatypes


Those data types must be compliant to the W3C specifications



Employee
	int
	String
	float
Student
Product

webservice is created in one language
is accessed from many other languages
