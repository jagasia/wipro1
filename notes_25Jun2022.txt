3:00 PM start
5:00 PM break
8:00 PM leave
------------------
One important activity to begin the project coding part:

1) The team leader will create a git repository
2) Push empty/ starter projects into the git
	frontend
	backend
		rest-api-1
		rest-api-2
		
3) The team leader creates Collaborators for the git repository.
4) The team members receive the invitation to collaborate by email. They accept.
5) Now, team members
	choose an empty folder where they will 
	pull the project from git
6) Then the team members 
	import backend to spring tool suite
----------------------------------------------------------
Activity #2:
----------------
So now, each team leader have created the project structure.
And shared with the team members.

Now, each team member now, has allocated entity.

Team member to create
	1) entity class
	2) repository interface
	3) service class
	4) controller class

	and test with postman


PUT YOUR GIT LINK IN THE GOOGLE SHEET
----------------------
Each team leader have created the git hub repository
and added the team members as collaborators.
(If this is pending, kindly complete this)

Each team member to pull the git repo to their project folder
	first
		git init
		git remote add origin https://github.com/Neeraja4716/Project_Team4.git
		git pull






https://github.com/Neeraja4716/Project_Team4.git



https://github.com/sumi-dj/group1


git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/sumi-dj/group1.git
git pull origin dj


@SpringBootApplication(exclude=SecurityAutoConfiguration.class)


Each team member
	first time for pulling the git
	git init
	git remote add origin https:///.....git
	git pull origin <<leader's branchname>>

	after that they will work on the project and want to push 
	you will push as your own branch.
	steps:
	
	git add .
	git commit -m "after adding my entities Product, Customer"
	git branch -M jag
	git push -u origin jag

understand onething:
	remote is already added. So in my above commands, i did not add remote	(otherwise it will say "remote already exists")

	git branch -M jag		(need not be repeated next time. git will remember your current branch)

next time
	git add .
	git commit -m message
	git push -u origin jag


But, if your branch in git hub, is modified by you or someone from anywhere
	you need to pull, and then only you can push

	git will tell you in that case:
		remote contains work that you do not have locally. Consider pull before push
	

go and see what are the branches found in github
	git pull origin branch1
	git pull origin branch2
		if you repeat pull command, if it says "already upto date" then you can go and push now.

then 
	git push -u origin jag
