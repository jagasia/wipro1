Yesterday we created a spring mvc project
	lets continue from there

Signup form when submitted, it should redirect to OTP page

if you want to send email from a java program,
	then gmail should allow "Less secure app access"
	this is normally OFF
	we have to turn it on.

login to gmail 

manage my account
	search:	less secure app access

Spring boot
---------------

What is spring boot
	spring boot framework is on the top of spring framework. It is not entirely different from spring at all.
	boot means bootstrap (not bootstrap we learnt in UI), some provision is ready, just need to bootstrap.

advantages:
	1) we can create a spring application without a need for IDE like eclipse / sts/ intellij
	we can obtain a project from spring initializr
		https://start.spring.io/

	this is a website and also there is a web service (that can accessed from spring tool suite)
		in sts, File -> New -> Spring starter project	(we are using spring initializr web service)

	2) we can run the project without a need for eclipse or sts
		normally how do we run a dynamic web project?
			right click project -> run as -> Run on server
		what happens if we do not have eclipse in a computer. How do we run a web application?
			A spring boot application can be run in cmd prompt also. Because, there is a main method that can be run
			that main method can start apache tomcat and deploy your project also

	3) built - in Apache tomcat server
		we run a java project main method, that will start apache server and deploy application
	
	4) Spring boot promotes 
		Convention over Configuration
			that means, we dont need to do much configuration when we follow convention
			convention means, guidelines
		ex:	
			if you put your classes inside the base package or its sub package, we do not need to define
				@ComponentScan(basePackage=
			what is base package?
				the package that conatins our Application file that has main method, that is the base package
			while creating the project, we mention the group id

	5) zero xml configuration model
	
	6) Opinionated POM
		you will see the pom.xml dependencies very meaningful or understandable
			starter dependencies	(combined dependencies)

	7) no need of war file for web applications
		in spring boot, the web applications are also created as stand alone applications.
		when we run main method, it will start server
	
	8) Auto configuration
		

	9) built in support for JSON
		REST api methods return java objects, then they are converted automatically into JSON
		we were doing that using GSON in spring. But in spring boot, it is automatic



Task:
	Identify the advantages of Spring boot framework.


Demo:
	First demo in spring boot should be:
		Create a spring boot application
		and run


	A spring boot application can be created from

	1)	start.spring.io

			this is called as spring initializr
	
	2) If we have spring tool suite, we can also use 
		File -> New -> Spring starter project
	
	
In this demo, we use spring initializr
	start.spring.io

Project:		Maven Project
Language:		Java
Spring boot:	2.7.0
Group:		com.wipro.hrms
Artifact:		jun09-boot-1
Name:		<<auto populated>>	skip this
Description:	anything
Package name:	same as group id
Java:		8

Click the Generate button

the project will be downloaded as zip file to downloads folder.


Task:
-------
	create your first spring boot application now using spring initializr

jun09-my-project
	in main method, print hello world and run


Run the project in cmd prompt

without using eclipse/ any ide,
run the project

------------------------
Steps for demo2:

1) go to spring initializr
	start.spring.io
2) create a spring boot application

3) unzip the project that is downloaded

4) go inside the folder where pom.xml is present

5) go cmd

6) mvn clean install
	this will create a .jar file in target folder
7) go inside the target folder
	cd target

8) java -jar jun09-demo-2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The spring boot app now, runs
