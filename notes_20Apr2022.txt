diff between cookie and localStorage

	cookie is created by server side script, but created in client's machine
	localStorage is created by client side script, and created in client's machine

Javascript vs Typescript

a typescript program is converte (compiled) into a javascript program before execution

javascript is not compiler based language. We do not compile javascript.

typescript is a compiler based language. we must compile a typescript program 

1) download and install node js
2) we will get npm once we install node js.
	that npm, is used to install many tools
		i) typescript compiler		tsc
		ii) angular			ng



https://nodejs.org/en/download/

after installing nodejs
	node -v
	npm -v

---------------
we are going to install
	tsc		
	angular cli

run the below command:
	npm install -g typescript		

check if typescript is installed
	tsc -v
	tsc --version

next, we install angular
	npm install -g @angular/cli

	
----------------------------------------
Typescript

a language
	that is compiled 
	after compilation, we get js code

Now, have you ever run a .js program alone?
	so far, we run js along with html only

now, i am going to show you how to run a .js program separately
in command prompt

we have installed node

but still, only when i run this javascript program, i confirm that there is no error in this program.

but js does not have compilation process.

syntax error???

whenever a new version of js comes, browser needs upgradation

so the idea is not to introduce new version of js
but a new language called typescript

any new version of typescript is not going to affect the browser

because, we are going to compile a typescript program into js

two.js
	this is a typescript file


compile a ts program
	tsc two.ts
run a js program
	node two.js


Task:
-------

create .ts file
	declare couple of variables
	add them
	and display them in console

compile this .ts file		(tsc)
and you will get .js file

run that .js file(node)

-------------------------------------------------------
typescript
Data types:

number
string
boolean
enum		(fixed set of values)
	enum Days {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday};
	let x:Days=Days.Monday;
	console.log(x);	//0
void			(functions)
null			no value is assigned
undefined		no type is assigned
any
		var z:any;
		z=20;
		z='rama';
		z=true;
never
		function fn1():never		
		{
			//somewhere we raise exception 		for sure
		}
array
		let arr:number[]=[1,2,3,4,5];
tuple
		let person:[string,number]=["Ram",100];

		many variable of diff types inside tuple





old version of typescript allowed us to declare variable
	without data type, without default value

new versions of typescript forces us to have default value

in java language, how do we do casting
float f=1.2f;
int i=(int)f;



now, in typescript, we can cast a string into number

var str:string='123';
var i:number=<number><any>str;


java-student.ts		file name
class JavaStudent

	typeof			returns the data type of the variable
	instanceof			returns true if it is instance of specified class

	if(x instanceof y)
		true if x is an object of y or any of its sub class





int i;		//java
i:number;		//typescript


int sum()		//java
sum:number	//typescript


------------------------------------------
Task:
	do all this in a single file	.ts file

i) create a function 
	sum that accepts 2 numbers and return a number
ii) call the function and supply 2 number variables
iii) display the result in console.


----------------------------
Angular
	history of angular
	the first version was called as Angular JS		version 1	
		no components
		controllers

	version 2 onwards, called as Angular

		components and services 


navbar
	
i could have stored that alone as a html segment
	.htm

	this segment file will not contain top html elements
		

that only contains html code.

a component in angular 
	is not only html code
		i) html code
		ii) css
		iii) typescript
		iv) testing code

all these 4 together forms a component

it is easy to plug or remove a component

First thing to do in angular is to create a project.
------------------------------------------------------------
As we have already installed angular CLI in our computer		(CLI stands for Command Line Interface)
in cmd prompt, we can run a command, and that is going to create an angular project

an angular project is a folder
	that contains
		node_modules	

ng new first-project

ng new my-new-project --style=css --routing

Lets understand the project that is being created

once the project is created, go inside the project folder

cd first-project

once you go inside the folder
	code .


SPA
	Single Page Application


the only html page is
	index.html
		this is the only page that contains
			<html>
				<head>
				</head>
				<body>
				</body>
			</html>


There can be many components, that can be plugged
but each component can have html code
	that does not have root or top html elements
A module called app is already there in the project

a module contains many components

while creating a project itself a component is created
	App component

To run angular project,
	go to cmd prompt 	(visual studio code terminal also)
		inside the project folder

	to run:
		ng serve -o

localhost:4200

@Component
	in java, we call it as annotation.
	in typescript, we call it as decorator
