Spring Framework
-----------------------
1) custom finder methods
2) find by multiple fields

Spring data JPA


Customer
	id
	password
	firstName
	lastName
	dateOfBirth
	email
	contact


jpa repository
@Repository
public interface CustomerRepository extends JpaRepository<Customer, String>
{

}


without defining any methods inside this repository,
	we have finder method
		findById	(it works with any primary key. 		sometimes, username is the key. then findById means finding by username)
			in our example, primary key is "id"	so findById		works for id	(coincidence)
what about finding customers by other properties
	findByFirstName
	findByLastName
	findByDateOfBirth


findBy
	is common

-------------------------------------------
When i add new methods to CustomerRepository,
how do i test those methods?

Normally, in a java project, 
	i can create object of any class and call the methods and test them.

now, in spring, 
	we don't create objects, we getBean from the IOC Container

we get bean using
	xml configuration or
	annotation configuration

but in spring boot, it is complex.

Proper way of testing the beans in spring boot:
	use junit testing


go to 
	src/test/java




findBy
	any of the properties of the entity class is possible.
-----------------------------------------
Task:
	1) Create a spring boot application
		spring web
		spring data jpa
		mysql driver
	2) Entity class
		have atleast 5 properites
	3) Repository interface extends JpaRepository
	4) go to src/test/java
		create the test for 
			findById
			findByX
				X can be any of the properties of entity class


------------------------
2) find by multiple fields
	findByFirstNameAndLastName

And
Or
Not
	are keywords

firstName 
lastName
	are fields

in java methods, every word first letter is capitalized


only for unusual requirements, we should use query.


@Query
	in jpa,
		we are querying the entities (not the tables)


from Customer
	is a query that returns all entities as a List<Customer

from Customer c where c.firstName LIKE '%a';

	all the customers first name that ends with a



Task:
	find by multiple fields

		in repository,
			create finder methods that search based on multiple fields
			use:	And / Or



MVC
	everything
		model, view, controller

REST api
	model and controller		(no view ie., not front end, UI, screens)


To dynamically change the UI in jsp,
we need to use JSTL core tag library

<c:if>
	some part are displayed conditionally


ModelMap
	model is scoped only for that request and response.

	if you move to some other url, that is a new request. Model is expired.

	I want to remember the user in every page. So the scope should be "session"

HttpSession


"Welcome" should be visible only if "customer" object is found in the session.	(mean, only when logged in)

TasK
---------
In mvc project,
	once the user has logged in successfully, the "customer" object must be stored in session.
	if session attribute "customer" is not null, then "Welcome <<firstName>>!" must be displayed in the header.
	else, welcome message entirely is removed

	Login (or) Logout option should be displayed based on the login status.
