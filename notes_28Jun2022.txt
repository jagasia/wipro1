master - transaction

PRODUCT MASTER
CUSTOMER MASTER
SALES TRANSACTION

there is only 1 row for a product in Product table		PRIMARY key
but the same product is sold many times in sales table.		FOREIGN key

when transactions happens,
we normally do not fill the form like

SID....................	auto generated		remove
PID.....................	we dont enter. we will choose the product from a gallery
QTY....................	we dont enter. qty becomes 1 when we add to cart		there can be - + buttons to change the quantity
AMOUNT...........	we dont enter, based on pid and qty, we can compute it
CID...................	we dont enter, because, who has logged in??? he is only buying

We do not type everything in a transaction. That is what it makes little complex when compared to a master

PRODUCT

PID.......................
NAME.................
DESC.............
PRICE...................
