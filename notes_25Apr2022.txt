Angular
---------
	going to learn Spring boot RESTful webservice (REST API/ microservices)

	we should be able to integrate angular project with microservices

	in that case, the front end part. ie, UI forms must be able to map to the java entity classes

	when i submit a form in angular, html form, it should be sent to microservices as an object (JSON)

To be able to do this seemlessly, we need to create forms that are easily converted into objects.

PRODUCT table in db
in java, 
Product.java

	class Product
	{
		id
		name
		price
	}

you know jdbc where a method accepts Product object and the code will store the record in the table in the db

basically, we need to send an object of product from
	the product form


Id:........................
Name:.......................
Price:..........................

buttons 	Add	Update	Delete


earlier, we imported "FormsModule" in app.module.ts file.

Now, i am going to import "ReactiveFormsModule" in app.module.ts
	this will represent a form as an object (JSON)



apr25-reactive-demo
	is the project

	cd apr25-reactive-demo

	code .

	ng serve -o

	localhost:4200/



Product
	id
	name
	price


lets create a new component "product"
	ng g c product
	ng generate component product



whenever we work on reactive forms, we start from .ts

	create a form group in .ts and then
	create a html form in .html file


TasK:
-------
	Create an employee component
	plug the component into app component

	an employee should have 
		id
		firstName
		lastName
		salary

	create employeeForm as a form group and
	map the members to the form controls

	display the employee form as JSON below the form


-----------------------------------------------------------
there are fake rest apis available
	dummy

	https://api.instantwebtools.net/v1/airlines

once we learn next modules like spring boot, we will be able to create rest apis like above

HTTP methods
	GET		retrieving records
	POST		add record
	PUT		update record
	DELETE		delete records



create a service
	a class 
	
	ng g s airline
	ng generate service airline


in the constructor of service class, inject the http client

	import "HttpClientModule" in the app.module.ts



REST api
	somebody has already completed the backend portion of the project
	they allow us to 
		add
		update
		delete
		get all records
		get record by id

	all these operations they allow us to do using
		URL


at this moment, what you need to understand about REST API is?
	i am creating a html form for getting input for adding an airline to the existing database (somewhere in server)
	when i click add button, i am just going to use an url to store the data in their db. This is allowed by REST API



lets create a airline component
	ng g c airline


when i click add button, a typescript function should be called



1) airline.service.ts
	in this service, we are going to access rest apis

	for this, inject "httpClient" to the constructor	(already we have imported HttpClientModule in app.module.ts)

2) in airline.component.ts
	in constructor
		inject the service



---------------------------
check this url
https://api.instantwebtools.net/v1/airlines/98765432




we are able to add an airline into the rest api
	bcos they allowed us to do so

	
Task:
-------
	Create 
		i) airline service
		ii) airline component
	
	add button to click
		and that should add an airline to the rest api




velocity@rpsconsulting.in



Now, that we are able to add an airline to the rest api.		CREATE
we are going to retrieve all airlines from the rest api.		READ

GET	https://api.instantwebtools.net/v1/airlines


for adding, we used POST mapping

for reading, we use GET mapping

anything that access the rest api is in service
	so we go to
		airline.service.ts
	and create one more method that will get 

	when call this get emthod, i will get an array of airline objects
	so, i need to capture the result in an array



--------------------------------------
Task:
1) create grid component
2) plug this component below the first row
	create another row of divs		give more propotion of the column width to 2nd column
3) in grid component ts,
	declare an array 	"airlines"
4) constructor injection of 
	AirlineService
5) in init method
	use the airline service object to get all airlines and store it in array

6) in grid html
	create a table
7) in <tr> use for each loop for array of airlines

Display the table with
	image for logo
	website to have hyperlink
