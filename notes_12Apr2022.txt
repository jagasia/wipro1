Solution for the task we had yesterday, ie., grouping the employees by their Dept and dept wise sum of their salaries.

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class App6 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		List<Employee> empList=new ArrayList<Employee>();
		empList.add(new Employee(12, "Ram", "ECE", 12121212.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(1, "Kumar", "ECE", 8989898.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(152, "Abdul", "Mech", 7798797.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(8, "Zaheer", "ECE", 8989898.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(11, "Xavier", "Mech", 3434344.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(10, "Babu", "Mech", 6868689689.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(7, "Raja", "CSE", 2342424.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(9, "Mohan", "ECE", 1234566.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(5, "Kumaresh", "CSE", 9876.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(18, "Jag", "ECE", 8765.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(4, "Dinesh", "CSE", 89890.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(2, "Rajesh", "ECE", 89898.2f));
		empList.add(new Employee(3, "Sakthi", "CSE", 866686.2f));
		
		Map<String, Double> result = empList.stream()
		.collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment, Collectors.summingDouble(Employee::getSalary)));
		
		System.out.println(result);
	}

}


If you remember, a program we did in Map

input a string as a sentence, 
and count the alphabets

	india is our country

i = 3
n = 2
d = 1
a = 1

this program, also you can simplify using Stream api

Junit
	
Type of testing
	unit testing
	integration testing
	white/ black box testing
	regression testing
	performance testing
	stress testing
	UI testing

Unit testing
	a method in java, can be tested independently
	a method may need inputs, that is obtained by using parameters
	a method may give output, that is using return type

	a method, hence can be tested independently

every method, (or unit) should be tested first before, integrating them.
because, while integrating, we need to check only the issues related to integration. Not the units

why we test a method?
	mostly to check the logic 
		inputs , expected output, actual output

	sum(int, int)
		2, 3, 5				2+3=5
		10, 20, 30				
		
	test cases like this.

	A test case contains, sample inputs, expected and actual outputs and the difference or deviation of expected vs actual makes the test pass / fail

Testing team creates the test cases.
But as java programmer, i want to test my code myself before i submit it to the testing team.

Test Driven Development
	i tested my code against 15 test cases

	write the code to fail
	modify the code to pass
	refactor the code


We use junit
	for java language

by adding a jar file to our project
or
if it is a maven project, we will add dependencies to the pom.xml



AUT	Application under test
SUT	Software under test



--------------------------------------------
1) Create a java project
2) Create a class with couple of methods (in my example, i had sum() and difference())
3) add junit.jar file to the project
	right click the project
		-> properties
			-> java build path
				-> 3rd tab (Libraries)
					-> click "Add external jar" button
						locate the junit.jar file
4) Create a test class
	write couple of test cases
		@Test annotation over the test methods
5) right click the project 
	run as
		junit test 
6) create an App class with main method
	Run the test using 
		JUnitCore.runClasses



@Before vs @BeforeClass annotation

@Before 
	methods are executed before every test

@BeforeClass
	methods are static and are executed only once for the class. 


@After vs @AfterClass

HTML5

Javascript ES6

HTML5
	HyperText Markup Language

	can we create a webpage without using HTML?
		NO

	applet
		java code runs only if <applet> tag is used. ie., HTML tag
	what is a webpage?
		if you run it using browser, it is a web page.	Browser understands HTML

	ex for browser
		Internet Explorer
		Google chrome
		Opera
		Microsoft Edge
		Mozilla Firefox

	
SGML	
	Standard Generalized Markup Language

	had predefined set of tags and also allowed users to create their own tags

	HTML is based on SGML

There are some rules in SGML that applies to HTML also

<img src="">	works fine in browser
but in react,

<img src="" />	notice that slace / at the end is compulsory in react



HTML rules:
	The root element of a HTML file is HTML

Element is also called as Tag

the root element of a web page is
<HTML>	
</HTML>

Why it is called as root element, 
	all other elements are present only inside the root element
	there is only 1 root element in any document.

Inside HTML element
	HEAD
	BODY


head
	the code inside HEAD element are loaded in the client's memory, even before the web page is displayed.
	So any script that you want to be available early, can be put inside <HEAD> element
	
body
	this portion of code is meant for display / presentation
	we can put scripts also in <BODY> element but they are loaded in memory only when it is arrived from Top - Bottom

	cannot call the function here. (top down)

	function 
	
	call the function



HTML language is meant for Presentation
	all that you do in HTML is to define how the data needs to be displayed
		<B>	bold
		<I>	italic
		<TABLE>
		<UL>
		<A>
		<P>
		<DIV>
		<SPAN>
		<h1>		top heading		largest
		<h2>		second level heading




basic Markup language rules:
	i) root element	(only 1) and all elements are inside root element
	ii) tags must nest properly
	the below code is nested properly:
		<tr>
			<td>
			</td>
		</tr>
	the below coded is not nested properly:
		<tr>
			<td>
			</tr>
		</td>
	the above code is overlapping and is incorrect

	iii) Every body tag / content tag should have 
		start tag
		end tag
	ex:
		<DIV>	</DIV>
		<P>	</P>
	otherwise
	iv) it is an empty tag
		an empty tag ends with />
	ex:
		<BR />
		<HR />
		<IMG />
	v) attribute values in double quotes "" even if it is a number

		<TABLE BORDER="1">		here, BORDER is the attribute for TABLE element

		most browsers do not raise error, if you do not follow this

	vi) entities
		in any markup language, certains symbols are used as syntax
	example:
		> symbol
		< symbol

		a>b		how to do this?


		<p> a>b </p>
	should be written as
		<p> a &gt; b </p>		

	&gt;	is	>
	&lt;	is	<
	&nbsp;	is	space

	

identify the types of elements:
	block elements
	inline elements
	

block:
	it is always displayed in separate line
	ex:
		<p>
		<div>
		
	THese elements always come in separate line inside the container


NOTEPAD:
Task:
	create a simple html program and view the output in a browser	


Now, these elements by default have some styles (CSS)

in cloud lab, Visual Studio code s/w is already installed

Visual Studio code is different from Visual Studio

Visual Studio code is FREE downloadable from microsoft website itself


In vs code, we can create a folder, files (no such create project like eclipse)

File menu -> new file (CTRL+N)
save the file with .html extension

in code edition
	type "html:5" and press enter


ctrl+space to get such options

<!DOCTYPE html> 		this refers to HTML version 5
<head> portion, we can mention meta data 
	<title>	displayed in the title bar of the browser
	
1) Identify the block elements in HTML
2) Identify the  inline elements in HTML

How can we dispay Headings in HTML?
<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>

Use all these headings in a HTML file and show me.

completed.	

How many heading elements are there in HTML
	6

List elements
	UL
	OL

UL
	un ordered list
		bullets
		icons

Task:
	create an un ordered list of countries
	but the bullet should be o

o	India
o	Australia
o	Srilanka
o	Pakistan
o	China
o	Japan


<ul type="disc | circle | square">


Task:
	display the ordered list of countries, but the order number should start from 21 onwards
