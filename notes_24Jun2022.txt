We start Project
	we have already 
		created the project title
		formed teams
		created a case study for each team

	now, it is performing phase.

Identify the technologies used in the project
Frontend:
	Angular
Backend:
	Spring boot REST api

------------------------------------------------
You can start identifying the entities involved in the project
ex:
	For a shopping website, 
		customer
		product
		cart
		order
		address

ellaborate the entities
	create the entity classes

ex:
	i ellaborate the entity called "customer"

Customer
	id
	firstName
	lastName
	address
	phone
	email
	dateOfBirth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activity #1:
Create the list of entities in your project
	Each team leader can create 
		a good doc (online word document)
		where you share the link to your team members
		you can write, see others typing and finalize the list of entities.





addMenu(@RequestParam("id") Integer id, @RequestParam("name") String name, @RequestParam("price") Double price


----------------------------------------------------------------
Team 10

Simply, to create a document and list the entities, these teams are not able to do in 74 minutes. Still i am waiting for them.

Activity #2:
--------------
Allocate each entity to a team member

---------------------------------------------------
Each Team leader,
	should create a git repository

all of you 

decide a folder in your system:
	that is not a part of git already.


ProjectNo3			this will be pushed into GIT
	frontend
	backend

notice a project1 folder has
	2 folders
	

team leader
creates the git repository
and shares the url to their team



git init
git add .
git commit -m "jun24_first"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/ProjectNo1.git
git branch -M jag
git push -u origin jag




Leaders, first create these 2 folders
and 
in frontend
	create angular project
in backend
	create a rest api

and push to the git

share the git url to other team members

Now, other team members cannot push anything
until they become collaborators

How do you add collaborators?


frontend:
	angular project name
		ng new super-store-frontend --routing --style=css

backend:
	spring boot project name
		super-store-product-rest
		super-store-customer-rest
		super-store-dealer-rest
