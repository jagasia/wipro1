Yesterday we created a git repository (i created) "may171" and 7 collaborators are added to the repository.

I have pushed an empty project to this repository.

7 collaborators have cloned my project into their system.

after cloning, each of them will add their java file into the project
ex:
	Jag.java

Each collaborator have to push the project to this repository, in their name as branch

	git config --global user.name jagasia
	git config --gloabl user.email rjagadeeswaran@Yahoo.com

	git config --global user.password "1234321"

to save credentials:	
	git config --global credential.helper store


go to cmd (your current location should have the project)

git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M jana
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/may171.git
git push -u origin jana


----------------------------
git clone	vs	git pull

you all have done "git clone"

so you got my repository as a folder that got downloaded to your system
	repository is "may171" this is downloaded as a folder

but

if we use git pull 
	the contents get pulled into the current folder

you create may171 folder and go inside and pull 


do not clone because, it is downloading the may181 repo as a folder

already downloaded, fine
go inside the folder
	now you will see, "jag-demo-1"
	this is the correct location

if binny already pushed as "binny", now you try as "binny1"

you can delete .git folder

del .git
y/n		y


git init
git add .
git branch -M binny1
git commit -m "second commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/may171.git
git push -u origin binny1



all of you, even if not collaborator, can see all the branches
you can pull
you can merge

see, if you can see 
	Jag.java
	Jana.java
	Spandana.java






git pull origin/jag
git merge origin/jag --allow-unrelated-histories

5 members in one POD
each member pull the empty project created by the POD leader

all of them contribute to the same project. But in different manner.

each of them will pull before push

after pull, we will be able to see the changes.

until you merge, both branches are available separately.

Agile
-------
	SDLC

has lot of phases
	if we follow from 1st phase to last phase in same order, can we called it as "Waterfall model"
Only if you have very clear idea about the project. And you have done this type of project several times, THEN only you can follow waterfall approach.

But, now a days, we do projects, that are new idea

Agile is a spiral model

	iterative
	multiple iterations

we will have sprints
	sprint means?
		in cricket, you know quick single


Sprint 1 
Sprint 2

these are example for milestones

JQuery
	is an application of javascript.
	that allows any javascript code to be used in jquery


Imagine, if there is an external javascript file.
	one.js

is it possible to use this js file in a html file?

	Yes. 
		<script src="one.js">
		</script>


we can use a js file like above.


Somebody has created a .js file and given it to us 
we can refer that in <script src=

and use it 

That is JQuery

JQuery can be obtained using 
	CDN
	local file
