Codelysis
	120 minutes practical test
	All are from core java.		(totally 4 questions. 25 marks each. Total=100 marks)
Remember, when we learnt core java, we used to solve lot of problems
	all the questions are in that pattern.
		a problem statement
		sample inputs
		sample outputs

	there will be hidden inputs and outputs	(test cases). You code should pass all those test cases.

---------------------------------------
Spring security
------------------
	spring boot mvc project
	spring boot rest api

what is the major threat you find?

i remember, during angular, one of you asked me "Whoever has the URL, can add an airline to the REST api?"
----------------------------------------------------------
the rest api allows anybody to access.
	Security is introduced to restrict, who can access and who cannot access.

Security is defined in terms of 
	Authentication
	Authorization

What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
	Authentication
		is the process of validating the identity of the user
		are you an user or not?

	Authorization	
		is the process of checking if the user has permission to do or not.
		Access Control List
		which are the users, allowed to do what are the activities
		the user is a valid user, but admin? or user?	or supervisor?	what is his role????	based on role, permissions are different

		

Authentication
	if you claim that you are suresh. unless you enter the username/password or pin number or OTP, you are not Suresh.
	authentication is passed, then the system can obtain the identity of the user
	that identity can also have role

USER_MASTER	table in the database
	username
	password
	firstname
	lastname
	role
	status		

in java, 
	User class


Demo:
--------
1)	i will create a spring boot app
2)		dependencies:
			spring web
			spring security

3) 	create a rest controller
4) 	simple method to display hello world
package com.wipro.hrms;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class MyController {
	
	@GetMapping("/")
	public String home()
	{
		return "Hello world";
	}
}


5) right click the project -> Run As -> Spring boot app

all are per minute. all are dollars
local = 0.25
STD = 1
ISD = 10
