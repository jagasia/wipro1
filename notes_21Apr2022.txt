Ensure that all of you have created an angular project (yesterday project is fine)

1) open the angular project folder in visual studio code
2) Run the project
	i) cmd prompt (inside the project folder)
	ii) ng serve 
		ng serve -o		(o for open the browser)



------------------------------------
Components
	what is a component in Angular?
		a component is a reusable unit that can be plugged into another component in angular

	whenever we create a project, there is one component that is created already
		app component

	a component is made up of 
		html		markup 		presentation
		css		styling
		ts		code	(script)
		spec.ts 		unit testing

	How to create component in angular?
		ng g c <<component name>>
		ng generate component <<component name>>

	what happens when i run the below component
		ng g c login

	login.component.html
	login.component.css
	login.component.ts
	login.component.spec.ts

		these are the 4 files created, when i run the command to create a component.

	ALSO,
		in app.module.ts file, the component will be declared

we have created a login component now.

conventions:
	the file name is always in lower case.
		login.component.ts 
	if you open this ts file
		there will be a class "LoginComponent"

	ng g c java-student

		@Component({selector:'app-login'})
		export class JavaStudentComponent
		{
		}

this login component must be plugged into app component

app component has 
	3 columns

in 2nd column, i am going to place the login component



TasK:
-------
create a sign up component and plug it inside the second column of app component

Hint
	1) in index.html, inside <head> portion, paste the bootstrap cdn

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>


	2) in app.component.html
		delete all the sample code 
	put this below scaffolding code in app.component.html

<div class="jumbotron text-center">
  <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
  <p>Resize this responsive page to see the effect!</p> 
</div>
  
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Column 1</h3>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit...</p>
      <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Column 2</h3>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit...</p>
      <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Column 3</h3>        
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit...</p>
      <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


------------------------------------------------------------------
binding:		(associating a variable to a html element or attribute)
-----------
	there is a variable in .ts file
	
	how to display the value of that variable in html file?
		ans: interpolation

What is interpolation?
	display the value of a variable

		{{username}}

double set brackets 
	only for output purpose
	one way from .ts variable to html output


binding types:
	property binding
	event binding
	2 way data binding



Property binding:
	there is a variable in .ts file
	we are binding that variable to a property

User Name: <input type="text" name="" id="" class="form-control" [value]="username">

<p><font [color]="color">This is a paragraph</font></p>

notice [] used for property binding

[value]="username"		username is a variable, whose value will be considered
[color]="color"		color is a variable, whose value will be considered


event binding:
----------------
	there is a function in typescript file
	we are binding that function to an event


Task:	property binding & event binding
------
	Signup form

		username
		password
		confirm password
		firstname
		lastname
		email
		
		Signup button and reset button

	the firstname and lastname textboxes should be bound to the variables declared in .ts file and the variables' values must be displayed in html
	the signup button click event must be handled by a function in typescript


2-way data binding:
-----------------------
	one side there is a typescript variable
	another side there is a property in html code

	it is similar to property binding but the difference is, a change in the html element reflects in typescript variable.

	if you notice in "property" binding, it was 1 way. The value of typescript variable is displayed in the html element
	but not vice versa

	what is 2 way data binding?
		when the property of html element is changed, then the change should reflect in the .ts variable also


	rules:
		html element must have a name


[(ngModel)]	banana in the box

User Name: <input type="text" name="" id="" [(ngModel)]="username" /> <br>

{{username}}


ngModel is defined in "FormsModule". so we need to import "FormsModule" in app.module.ts file

import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

 imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule
  ],


Task:
	create a component called "home"

	textbox should be bould in 2 way with a variable called "color" (in .ts)

	color:string='blue';	
	
	when the texbox value is changed, then the same must be displayed

	a paragraph color should be changed accordingly


remember to import "FormsModule" in app.module.ts file

Color: <input type="text" name="" id="" [(ngModel)]="color"><br>
<p><font [color]="color">This is a paragraph</font></p>
		


Task:
	create a dropdownlist containing few color names
	when the dropdownlist is changed, the color of the paragraph also should change




Task:
	use property binding to bind a text box to a variable in .ts file
	so that, the textbox will become
		<input type="text" />		or
		<input type="password" />	



	show password???		masked
