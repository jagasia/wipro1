Spring boot REST API
	we created an employee-service yesterday.

that rest api (restful webservice) has everything about backend but not the front end. 
	CRUD operations are performed by the REST api. And each method have a URL with http methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

There are sometimes, complex types used in the entity
	date
	time
	picture
	audio/video

The UI part is not there in a rest api (if UI/ front end is also done, then it is MVC project)

Who will provide the frontend/ UI part?
	Angular project 

Tell me the steps for creating a rest api

Example for this project is Food
zomato/swiggy
	these kind of apps have an entity called food	(menu/ item)
		id
		name
		price

Item.java
		id
		name
		price

1) entity class
2) repository interface
3) service class
4) controller class	

ofcourse, application.properties to have
	port number		default: 8080
	data source configuration

after creating the rest api, we will test it in POSTMAN for all the http methods GET/POST/PUT/DELETE

then we create angular project that provides FRONTEND for the same

we have completed the REST API for item
item-service is ready and running in port 8383

http://localhost:8383/item


shall we create the front end in Angular

how to create an angular project?
	ng new food-app --style=css --routing

we have created a component called "item"
	ng g c item

we are using ReactiveFormsModule	
	import it in app.module.ts


we have added one more component "item-grid" and display at the bottom (in second row)

this grid should display all the items available in the database

for that we should access the rest api

http://localhost:8383/item

how can angular project call a rest api?
	remember, we accessed airlines rest api????

Answer:
	using HttpClientModule

	import this HttpClientModule in app.module.ts




Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8383/item' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

CORS
	Cross Origin Resource Sharing
		is a policy that protects a service from unauthorized access.

Solution:
	go to controller class and add the following to allow cors
	
@RestController
@CrossOrigin({"http://localhost:4200","*"})
@RequestMapping("/item")
public class ItemController {



Task:
pull the food-service rest api from the following git repository
	https://github.com/jagasia/wipro1/tree/jag3/Java/spring


Tell me the categories of the food items:
Break Fast
Lunch
Dinner
Snacks
Desserts

The rest api should allow us to get all categories

SELECT DISTINCT i.category FROM Item i;


Picture property should be added to the entity class
	what should be the type of this property

Do you remember, when we learn IO chapter in java
	streams, reader

we learnt to read all the bytes from the picture file

picture/ audio/ video 
	all are nothing but bytes

so we will use byte []

in mysql, for image
	tinyblob		default
	mediumblob
	longblob		suitable for images


alter table item modify picture longblob;
