backend is REST api
frontend is Angular

in project
login and logout
	how do we want to use in project?
		Spring security
			we can allow certain URLs using permitAll()
				merchant registration		allowed
				merchant login		allowed
				customer registration		allowed
				customer login		allowed


*registration

Normalization
	split a large table into multiple smaller tables

USER

angular + rest api jwt

Task:
	https://github.com/jagasia/spring-jwt-jun22

run this spring security jwt project and tell me if you face any issues.



 const httpOptions = {
      headers: new HttpHeaders({
          // 'Content-Type':  'application/json',
           Authorization: 'Bearer ' + jwt,
      })
  };




in Angular
	how we are going to use jwt?

1) login and signup are free access. So no need to worry about jwt
2) but when login is successful, we get a JWT token as a response data.
	that jwt should be stored in the localStorage
		localStorage for permanent.	But token is valid only for 10 hours (as per our jwtUtil)
		sessionStorage for temporary.


3) whenever we access any other urls,
	take the jwt from localStorage and
	use it in the header

	if token is not found in localStorage,
		we can display 
			"You have not logged in, click here to go to login page"
