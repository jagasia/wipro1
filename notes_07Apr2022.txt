-------------------------------------
String is immutable
	what is meant by immutable?
		can't change



String class does not allow us to inherit.	String is final	
public class App1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String str="hello";
		str="hell";			//hell is a different object in diff memory. we have shifted from "hello" to "hell"
		//i cannot change the value of str. This is what you mean?
		str="world";
		System.out.println(str);
	}

}



look at the above code, it looks like i am able to change the value of a string

then how can we call the string as immutable?

	str="world";	// i am not changing the value of the str. i am changing the reference of the string



Employee rama=new Employee();
Employee john=new Employee();

Employee x=rama;
x=john;

Do you say that x has changed its value???
	NO, the reference (the object itself) has changed
	we will not say that x was rama and 
		x is john. Both are same object????no they are diff obj









int i=20;
i=21;		i is always in same memory location

Date dt=new Date();
dt has 
	day
	month
	year
i am allowed to change the values	(without changing the ref of the object)
Date dt1=dt;		//both dt and dt1 are ref to same memory


String is peculiar that will change or jump to diff memory if you want to change the value

in java old versions,
	String was not stored in "heap" memory. 
	String was stored in a memory structure called, "Permanent generation" area, 	permgen.

	Garbage Collector removes memory from "heap" only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
String str1="hello";	//string literal
String str2="hello";
str1==str2		//what is the output?

	== operator compares the values, if the operands are value types
	== operator compares the reference, if the operands are ref types


int i=20;
int j=20;

i==j		the values of i and j are compared
		bcos i and j are value types

		primitives are value types

Task:
	accept an input from the user as a String
	print the output as 
		"Palindrome" or "Not Palindrome"

Hint:	What is a palindrome?		
		is a string which is same when read forward or reverse.
ex:
	Malayalam		(case insensitive)
	Madam
	Mom
	Dad


while checking if the given input is a palindrome or not?
	did any of you thought like, if there is a method to reverse a string,
	then we can compare, the string with its own reverse
	if both are equal, then it is palindrome.



Yes, but String class do not have "reverse" method.
StringBuilder has

StringBuilder
StringBuffer

	both these classes have exactly same set of properties and  methods
	the only difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer is that StringBuffer is "Synchronized". Means, StringBuffer does not allow multiple threads to access at a time.	Hence, StringBuffer enforces lock, so it is slow. 

StringBuilder has "reverse" method.

lets see how to solve this problem using sb


Task:
	Identify as many methods of StringBuilder



Task:
	Accept a sentence as input from the user.
	Replace all the "is" into "was"


replace(start,end,str)
indexOf("is")






import java.util.Scanner;

public class App3 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String input=sc.nextLine();
		String result = input.replaceAll(" is ", " was ");
		System.out.println(result);
	}

}



String class:
	substring
	indexOf
	indexOf(str,fromIndex)		means, you want to search from given index
	lastIndexOf()			
	charAt
	toLowerCase
	toUpperCase
	toCharArray
	equals
	equalsIgnoreCasae
	startsWith


Task:
	accept an input and tell whether the person is a Lady or Gentleman.

	hint:
		The input starts with Mr. means, a gentleman
		The input starts with Ms. or Mrs. means, a lady

		

Regular Expression:
------------------------
	email  address
	password
		must contain atleast 
			1 upper case
			1 lower case
			1 number
			1 symbol
		8 characters minimum

	Employee id should be like
		E001			Starts with "E" followed by 3 digit number

	Name of the persion should 
		start with upper case alphabet only
		contain atleast 2 character
		not contain any number

	Pin code must be 6 digit. 	All of them are numeric digits only.

	mobile number can start with 
		+91 followed  by 0 digit number
		


Reg ex in java:
	there are 2 operations that can be done in Regular Expression
	i) check if the given string matches a pattern or not		boolean	true/false
	ii) extract the portions of the string that matches a pattern
		ex:
			Please note down this number 9898989898 and contact him immediately. If that number is not reachable then call landline 			0443939393939. Thank you
		from this above string, extract only the numbers and display



import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class ExtractNumbers {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String input=sc.nextLine();
		Pattern p= Pattern.compile("[0-9]+");
		Matcher m = p.matcher(input);
		while(m.find())
		{
			System.out.println(m.group());
		}
	}

}


Identify the symbols used in Regular Expression:-
------------------------------------------------------------
\d		digit
\D		non digit



in reg ex, there should be a symbol for  pattern, and multiplicity

	ex:	\d{3}			3 digits
		\d+			1 or more
		\d*			0 or more
		\d?			0 or 1 	optional

		\d{1,3}			minimum 1, maximum 3
		\d{1,}			minimum 1, maximum ??? unbounded		1 or more
		
[]	used to specify the list of possible characters that can come. One among the list
[.]	it means . as a character. Else . is a symbol that matches with anything

[aeiou]		either	a/ e/ i/ o/ u
[a-z]		a to z
[A-Za-z0-9]	means, an upper case or lower case alphabet or a digit	

.		dot means, anything

()		brackets to group an expression, so that for that group, you can specify a multiplicity

|		or operator
