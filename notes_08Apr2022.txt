Reading and Writing data from files:
--------------------------------------------
IO		
	Input Output

	not only means for files.

	Inputs can be obtained from various sources
		file
		keyboard		System.in
		network
		buffer

	Ouput can be sent to
		file
		monitor		System.out
		network
		buffer

java.io	package

IO Streams
the inputs and outputs can be 2 types
	character/	text
	binary/	byte

Character based Input operations, we use
	Readers
Character based Output operation, we use
	Writers

Binary input operations,
	InputStream
Binary output operations,
	OutputStream

java.io package has several classes for different purposes:
	every class is different.



FileInputStream
	what is this class?
		to read bytes from a File

BufferedInputStream
		to read bytes from buffer

FileReader
		to read characters from file

ObjectInputStream
		to read objects from a stream (NOT VERY CLEAR, from where it is going to read from)

There are some streams which are called as NODE stream
	they point to a definite node.
		ex:
			FileInputStream
			FileReader
			FileOutputStream
			FileWriter
			System.in

There are some stream which are called as FILTER stream
	they work on other streams
		ex:
			ObjectInputStream		reads data as objects, but from where/????? from another stream
			DataInputStream		reads data as primitive data types 
			BufferedInputStream		read bytes with a buffer size
			BufferedReader		read characters from another stream

	ObjectInputStream ois=new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(f));		//object input stream works on another stream


File
	what is a file?
		stored  data	i store data in arrays. or variables. How does file differs from a variable?
		collection of data	i know collections like ArrayList. How does file differs from array list?

		what is the difference between memory and storage?
		memory is temporary, volatile
			when program stops, or when power is gone, memory is erased
			All variables, objects, arrays, collections, we create are volatile.
		storage is permanent. 
			Files are stored in secondary storage devices	(hard disk, pen drive)
		

	tell me some file types:
		pdf
		jpg
		gif
		png
		xls
		doc
		txt
		
	in my opinion, there are only 2 categories of files
		text file
		binary file

	except .txt file, everything else is binary file.


	i create a file using Excel software, 
	i should open the file later, using Excel software

	if i open the file using notepad, how it will be?????	
		blunder. That is not going to help

	Similarly, if i create a file using java program,
	i access the file using java program only.
	BUT text files can be opened using text editors like notepad


File is in secondary storage device, and any operation, we do using program, (read/ write) cannot be done directly in the secondary storage.
We need to represent the file as an object in memory. 
All operations can be performed only on the object in the memory.

if i cannot remember the operands, i cannot do the operation (called sum)		

so, computer also, needs to load the file from secondary storage to main memory as object and then only we can perform any operation (read/write)

When i represent a file as an object in memory, 
	File obj;

File is a class in java.io package.

File can be
	file
	folder		(directory)

d:\jag\sameer.txt

in java string literals
	\ is an escape sequence

\\	is 	\
\"	is 	"


list out all the files and folders present in a location:
because, File class represents not only file, but also folders also

demo:
	list all the files and folder names of D:\\Jag

TasK:
	Write a java program to display only the files present in a specific folder (do not display folder name, display only the file names)

Hint:	instead of calling "list()", call listFiles() method


import java.io.File;

public class App3 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		File f=new File("d:\\jag");
		for(File x:f.listFiles())
		{
			if(!x.isDirectory())
				System.out.println(x);
		}
	}

}







File handling
----------------
Create a file
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class App4 {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		File f=new File("abcd.txt");
		if(!f.exists())
		{
			f.createNewFile();
			System.out.println("File not found. So we created it now");
		}else
		{
			System.out.println("File already present in "+f.getAbsolutePath());
		}
	}

}

Create a folder

Reading and writing files:
------------------------------
text/ binary

binary:
	anything other than text is binary

picture
video
audio
dat

Example:
	read all bytes from a picture 
	create a new file
	write all bytes into that file


C:\Users\rjaga\Pictures\paratta.jpg

how can we read all the bytes from this file?
	InputStream
		is an abstract class

	FileInputStream
		should be used to read bytes from a file
		where do we keep the bytes that are read from the file????
			byte array	(what should be the size of this array?)
				length of the file	(File)

after that, we need to write those bytes into a file. Which class should we use?
	FileOutputStream




import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class App6_ReadingBytes {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		File f=new File("C:\\Users\\rjaga\\Pictures\\paratta.jpg");
		int len = (int) f.length();
		byte []arr=new byte[len];
		
		FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream(f);
		fis.read(arr);
		fis.close();
		//-----------------------------------------------
		
		FileOutputStream fos=new FileOutputStream("D:\\Jag\\wipro\\wipro1\\wipro1\\roti.jpg");
		fos.write(arr);
		fos.flush();
		fos.close();
		System.out.println("Done");
	}

}


-------------------------------
sometimes, the file size is huge
	a blue ray file 	8 GB

	if RAM is 4 GB or even 8 GB

it is not possible sometimes to keep the 
	entire content of the file as byte array

So, we read 1 byte at a time and
	write that 1 byte into the file 
	and repeat until there is any more byte 


import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class App7 {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
		FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("C:\\Users\\rjaga\\Pictures\\briyani1.jfif");
		FileOutputStream fos=new FileOutputStream("D:\\Jag\\wipro\\wipro1\\wipro1\\images\\briyani2.jpg");
		int data=-1;
		while((data=fis.read())!=-1)
		{
//			Thread.sleep(10);
			fos.write(data);
			fos.flush();
		}
		fis.close();
		fos.close();
	}

}




---------------------------------------------
What is the java.io class that is used to write text data into a file	
	FileWriter
and read text data from a file
	FileReader

Task:
	Write a program to get the following inputs from the user
		Name
		Address
	Store this information in a text file



import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class App8 {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		File f=new File("D:\\Jag\\wipro\\wipro1\\wipro1\\sameer.txt");
		FileReader fr=new FileReader(f);
		int i=-1;
		while((i=fr.read())!=-1)
		{
			System.out.print((char)i);
		}
	}

}





--------------------------------------------
Scanner
	can also be used to read from a file
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);



import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class App9 {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
		File f=new File("D:\\Jag\\wipro\\wipro1\\wipro1\\sameer.txt");
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(f);
		String str="";
		while(sc.hasNext())
		{
			str=sc.nextLine();
			System.out.println(str);
		}
	}

}

-----------------------
Task:
	download the txt file from
		https://github.com/jagasia/wipro1/blob/jag3/AllCityMonthlyRainfall.txt

	it is a csv file.
	read the lines 1 by 1 using Scanner
	and in each line, display the 
		zipCode, cityName and then the average of the given marks



10002,New York,24,15,17,16,11,10,9,4,24,36,40,32
99501,Alaska,14,24,36,40,27,16,15,34,15,10,9,32
20019,Washington,11,20,12,20,10,15,20,21,19,10,11,12
30381,Atlanta,25,26,23,20,21,22,21,21,20,19,18,11
27565,Oxford,6,7,11,14,9,8,14,15,9,9,10,11
85054,Phoenix,12,11,12,11,10,14,15,14,15,12,10,9
90080,Los Angeles,6,5,4,5,4,5,6,8,4,5,9,4








D:\Jag\wipro\wipro1\wipro1\AllCityMonthlyRainfall.txt










import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class App10 {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
		File f=new File("D:\\Jag\\wipro\\wipro1\\wipro1\\AllCityMonthlyRainfall.txt");
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(f);
		while(sc.hasNext())
		{
			String line=sc.nextLine();
			String[] arr = line.split(",");
			//find avg of all the marks
			int totalLength=arr.length;
			int numbersLength=totalLength-2;
			int marks[]=new int[numbersLength];
			int count=0;
			int sum=0;
			for(int i=2;i<totalLength;i++)
			{
				sum+=Integer.parseInt(arr[i]);
				count++;
			}
			float avg=(float)sum/count;
			System.out.printf("%5s\t%-15s\t%.2f",arr[0],arr[1],avg);
			System.out.println();
		}
	}

}

--------------------------------------------------
DataInputStream
DataOutputStream

	data means primitive data
		int, char, float, byte, short, long, double, boolean

to write primitive data into a file, use DataOutputStream

import java.io.DataOutputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class App11 {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int sno=sc.nextInt();
		float avg=sc.nextFloat();
		boolean isSelected=sc.nextBoolean();
		//write all of them into the file
		FileOutputStream fos=new FileOutputStream("mydat.dat");
		DataOutputStream dos=new DataOutputStream(fos);
		dos.writeInt(sno);
		dos.writeFloat(avg);
		dos.writeBoolean(isSelected);
		dos.flush();
		dos.close();
		System.out.println("Done");
	}

}






import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class App12 {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
		DataInputStream dis=new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream("mydat.dat"));
		int i=dis.readInt();
		float f=dis.readFloat();
		
		boolean b=dis.readBoolean();
		
		System.out.println(i);
		System.out.println(f);
		
		System.out.println(b);
		
		
	}

}



we need to use ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream
so that we can write objects into the files

objects will solve this problem. 

But whenever we write objects into a stream, we call it as Serialization
whenever we read objects from a file, and store it in an object, it is called Deserialization

What is serialization?
	the process of converting an object into a series of bytes

how to do?
	this is done by ObjectOutputStream itself, but only those classes that implements Serializable interface can be serialized.

Serializable is a marker interface
	what is marker interface?
		an interface that do not have any abstract method is called as marker interface.
