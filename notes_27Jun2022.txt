Angular routing:
-------------------
Why routing?
	because, even thought an angular component has .html file, it is not a complete page.
	html file do not have 
		<html>	or <head> or <body> nothing. only the segment of the code is there
	so we do not give hyperlink to html files in angular.

in order to give link to components, we need routing.

for each component, we need to create a "path". 

when we choose routing while creating the project:
	--routing

then a file will be created in our project folder

	app-routing.module.ts

		this is where we create the paths
		a path is a mapping to component

ex:

login component
signup component
home component


i will place a <router-outlet> in the 2nd column

whenever we give link to a component, that component will be displayed in the 2nd column	(wherever the router-outlet is found)



routing navigation can be done in .ts also

if condition is true
	navigate to home
else
	navigate to signup

for that,
you can inject the router to the constructor of the component



import { Router, ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
constructor(private router: Router, private route: ActivatedRoute)


this.router.navigate(['about']);
